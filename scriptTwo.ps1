# Script 2 â€“Gathering Information from Computers in the Enterprise
# The following are guidelines as you create this script:
# You should primarily use WMI classes to gather information.  
    # Quick teaching moment here: Windows has been around for decades, and if you look at the 
    # PowerPoint I uploaded in a previous class as optional reading called PowerShellDay 3, 
    # it shows how there is something called the WMI Architecture which shows you can access 
    # many of the objects in the windows operating system, regardless ofwhen/how they were 
    # created over the years, through the WMI Scripting API.Do a Google search and briefly learn about WMI classes and accessing WMI using PowerShell.

# Your script should be as comprehensiveas possible.
# Example information may include BIOS information, programs installed on the computer, current programs running, accounts that exist on the computer, etc.
# While the script by default should run on the machine where it is executed, it should also be able to be executed for a remote machine(assuming you have rights).


# Your script should be able to be called from a PowerShellconsole and appropriate parameters passed to it.
# Feel free to usethe internet to find potential solutions;however, you should not copy scripts exactly as you find them online.  You should write them yourself but can be guided by what you find. 
# Make sure that you comment your script.
# Your script should save the outputof the information that it gathersto a file.You can determine the type and organization of the file.
